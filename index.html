    <li>: what is the role of front-end in a python full stack application?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>the front-end is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. it includes everything users see on their screen such as buttons, forms, and layouts. in a python full stack application, the front-end is usually built using html, css, and javascript, and it communicates with the python back-end (for example, flask or django) to fetch or send data.</li>
    </ol>
    <li> which technologies are commonly used for front-end development?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>common technologies used for front-end development include html for structure, css for styling, and javascript for interactivity. frameworks and libraries like bootstrap, react, vue.js, or angular can also be used to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>how does the front-end communicate with the python back-end?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>a static web page displays the same content for all users and does not change unless the code is modified. a dynamic web page can display different content and respond to user interactions. dynamic pages use javascript to update the content without reloading the entire page, often by calling the back-end for new data.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>what is responsive web design and why is it important?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>responsive web design means creating web pages that look and work well on all devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobiles. it uses flexible layouts, media queries, and scalable images. it is important because users access websites from different devices, and a responsive design ensures a good user experience everywhere.</li>
    </ol>
    <li> what is the purpose of a front-end framework like react in python full stack?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>a front-end framework like react helps developers build reusable and efficient user interfaces. in a python full stack project, react can be used for the front-end to create a fast and interactive ui, while the python back-end (like flask or django) handles business logic and data. react makes it easier to manage complex ui states and improves performance</li>
