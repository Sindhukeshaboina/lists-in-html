    <li>: what is the role of front-end in a python full stack application?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>the front-end is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. it includes everything users see on their screen such as buttons, forms, and layouts. in a python full stack application, the front-end is usually built using html, css, and javascript, and it communicates with the python back-end (for example, flask or django) to fetch or send data.</li>
    </ol>
    <li> which technologies are commonly used for front-end development?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>common technologies used for front-end development include html for structure, css for styling, and javascript for interactivity. frameworks and libraries like bootstrap, react, vue.js, or angular can also be used to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>how does the front-end communicate with the python back-end?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>a static web page displays the same content for all users and does not change unless the code is modified. a dynamic web page can display different content and respond to user interactions. dynamic pages use javascript to update the content without reloading the entire page, often by calling the back-end for new data.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>what is responsive web design and why is it important?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>responsive web design means creating web pages that look and work well on all devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobiles. it uses flexible layouts, media queries, and scalable images. it is important because users access websites from different devices, and a responsive design ensures a good user experience everywhere.</li>
    </ol>
    <li> what is the purpose of a front-end framework like react in python full stack?</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>a front-end framework like react helps developers build reusable and efficient user interfaces. in a python full stack project, react can be used for the front-end to create a fast and interactive ui, while the python back-end (like flask or django) handles business logic and data. react makes it easier to manage complex ui states and improves performance</li>

<ul>
    <li>: what is the importance of html in front-end development?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>html (hypertext markup language) is the foundation of all web pages. it provides the basic structure of a website using elements like headings, paragraphs, forms, and links. every front-end project starts with html, as it tells the browser how to display content on the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> how is css used in front-end development?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>css (cascading style sheets) is used to style and layout html elements. it controls the appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. css makes websites visually attractive and helps create responsive designs using techniques like flexbox and grid.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <li>what is javascript and how does it improve the front-end?</li>
    <ul>
         <li>javascript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. it allows developers to create features like sliders, popups, form validations, and live updates. in a full stack project, javascript can also send and receive data from the python back-end using api calls</li>
    </ul>
        
        
    <li>what is the dom in front-end development?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the dom (document object model) is a tree-like structure created by the browser when a web page loads. it represents the html elements on the page as objects that can be accessed and modified using javascript. interacting with the dom allows developers to change the content, structure, or style of a page in real-time.</li>
    </ul>
        
        
    <li> what are some common tools used in front-end development?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>common front-end tools include code editors like vs code, browser developer tools, and version control systems like git. frameworks like bootstrap and react help build modern user interfaces. package managers like npm are used to manage front-end libraries and dependencies.</li>

    web development is the work involved in building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on browsers. it includes several aspects such as web design, front-end development, back-end development, server management, and database integration. <br><br>
    front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive parts of the website that users see and use. this includes layout, buttons, forms, animations, and responsiveness. technologies used in front-end development include html, css, javascript, and frameworks like react or bootstrap. <br><br>
    back-end development involves server-side logic and database handling. it is responsible for storing, retrieving, and processing data. popular back-end languages include python, php, node.js, and java. frameworks like django and flask (for python) help manage the back-end efficiently. <br><br>
    a full stack developer works on both the front-end and back-end, managing complete web solutions. web development also includes other important tasks like version control, debugging, deployment, and performance optimization.
